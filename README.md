# Jumplocked (working title) Game for the Playdate
An endless runner for the playdate, where you play as a wizard propelling himself to an unknown goal.
In this game, jumping with A is helpful to stay airborne, but increases difficulty each jump.

## Notes
This is my first game for the Playdate and the first thing I've ever written in Lua, so bare with my 
heavily commented code. I had a lot of fun making this one, hope you enjoy!
